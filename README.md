# bank_api_kata

----------
Task
----------
The purpose of the exercise is to create an REST API for the customer of the bank that will be used to make money transfers between accounts.
You will need to design and implement:

Use Cases
* Create money transfers from one account to another
* View transactions after transfer completed under each account 

Tech Requirements
* You can use vanilla js or typescript
* No need to perform auth checks to keep things simple
* You can use frameworks/libraries if you like, keep at minimum as possible
* Do not use a DB Service like MongoDB or MySQL, instead use in-memory storage or build your own service.
  Also avoid to use a ORM module
* Use GIT to track your changes, please send us a zip file with ./git included*
* Include in the code automation testing to check that the API works as expected.
* Errors should be properly handled
* Itâ€™s desirable to implement with DDD/Clean architecture is preferred.
